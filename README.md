I specialise in the architecture of complex system environments.  
In my past I have worked as a software developer and system administrator.  
With my experience as a developer and sysadmin, I can offer the almost perfect link between both worlds.


For me, looking outside my own silo is an integral part of my work and creates an understanding of problems in different projects.
I have made it my mission to scrutinise existing decisions, concepts and architectures. Even when it gets uncomfortable (for both sides).

I acquire my knowledge through practical tasks and projects in â€˜hands-onâ€™ mode. This never prevents me from taking advantage of the help and knowledge of my colleagues.

After the development of functional proof-of-concepts, I remain available as a consultant for every project.

In addition to my extensive knowledge of CI/CD, CoreMedia, Magnolia, automation and monitoring, I am actively involved in various open source projects.
